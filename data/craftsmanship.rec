Title: Don’t Know What You Want? Improve These 7 Universal Skills
Link: Self-Discipline: Get better at ignoring the negative voice in your head. Get out of your bed. Go to the gym. Don’t listen to “I don’t want to.”
Body: Personal Effectiveness: Learn how to maximize the results you can get during the 16–18 hours you’re awake. Get more done — effectively.
+ Communication: We think we’re all master communicators. But the truth is that we suck. Communication is both art and science. And our ability to work with others depends on it.
+ Negotiation: You negotiate all the time. With your spouse, kids, parents, teachers, friends, co-workers, managers, etc. Learn to get the best deal for all parties.
+ Persuasion: Learn how to get what you want in an ethical way.
+ Physical Strength & Stamina: Getting stronger is a skill. Pull your own weight. It’s something every human should be able to do.
+ Flexibility: Sitting all day long behind your computer or in your car turns you into a stiff being. Learn how to stretch your hips, lower back, hamstrings, and calves — the most common weak points of desk workers.

+ 1. Premature Optimization: Optimizing before you know that you need to.
+ 1. Planning Fallacy: Optimistically underestimating the time required to complete a task
+ 1. Recency Bias: Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past
+ 
+ > We can never completely eliminate our biases, by being aware of how it is affecting us, we can somewhat mitigate the problems it causes.

Link: https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/
Body: I've read this paper commentary by Adrian Colyer (on a paper by Zheng Gao, Christian Bird, Earl T. Barr) on a study that tries to reproduce fixes for defects based on the dynamic to static typing system. 
+ 
+ >  both Flow and TypeScript are pretty good, and conservatively either of them can prevent about 15% of the bugs that end up in committed code.
+ 
+ It's interesting to see these effects quantified: 
+ 
+ > Running the binomial test on the results shows that, at the confidence level of 95%, the true percentage of detectable bugs for Flow and TypeScript falls into [11.5%, 18.5%] with mean 15%.
+ 
+ Also, some recommendations for the future: for typescript and flow to be compatible for more gains.

+ Dependencies are services that the object needs from its environment so that it can fulfil its responsibilities.
+ Notifications are other parts of the system that need to know when the object changes state or performs an action.
+ Policies are objects that tweak or adapt the object's behaviour to the needs of the system.
+ Parts are components in the implementation that are not controlled from outside the object after being set.

Body: The author explains why some feedback is dangerous: either the way of giving it, or the message, or both.\nIn this case, she's talking about the Commit Conf, but this is applicable to any situation\nPara dar un buen feedback es importante:\n\n  * Primero: agradecer el esfuerzo por la charla.\n  * Segundo: resaltar algo positivo de ella.  Seguro que algo cumple.\n  * Tercero: decir cómo mejorarías un aspecto\n  * Último: volver a dar las gracias o decir una frase buena que motive.\n \nDar un mal feedback es muy fácil:\n\n  * Primero: no leerte la descripción ni el nivel de la charla\n  * Segundo: te cabreas porque no es lo esperado y dudabas entre esa y otra charla\n  * Tercero: dices lo que no te ha gustado sin rodeos.\n  * Cuarto: además asumes cosas que no ha hecho y las escribes. Igual que yo he hecho en el Primero y Segundo.\n  * Quinto: si además dices algo faltoso gana puntos.\n  * Sexto: Utilizas esa tónica destructiva en todos.

Title: Ask HN: How to be productive with big existing code base
Link: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19254008
Body: In this HN discussion, there are some pearls regarding working with big, legacy codebases:\n\n  * Just because you wouldn't have done it the way they did doesn't mean they did it wrong. A reference to [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence)\n  * A reference to Working Effectively With Legacy Code, by Feathers\n  * > 1. Assess how much of the code is actually understood. Is there any record of the > design decisions, the edge cases, the debugging process, the paths that weren't taken? Who knows the most about the codebase and how it got to be how it is?\n  * > 2. What's the current specification? Don't look at the stack, look at input and output cases. How well does the code meet the spec? Where is it failing?\n  * > 3. Before you change anything you need to know what the change process is. You > probably do already know this, but if you don't need to find out whether there are > any demarcations of responsibility, even if they're only informal and unstated areas of interest.\n  * > 4. When you have all that, you can start working on the code with some knowledge of the context you - and the code - are operating in.\n  * > 5. If code works, don't rewrite or refactor for style without a very very good > reason. And don't do it unless you can change all the "bad" code at once. Otherwise > you'll end up with a mess of incompatible idioms that make future changes hard to read.\n  * > 6. Write your own docs as you go. Best case is other people will benefit from reading them, worst case is you'll remind yourself what you were doing six months from now - because you'll have forgotten by then.\n  * A reference to flamegraphs\n  * > The problem with the after-the-fact abstraction layer is that if the original team members are not available, you are likely not in possession of the whole theory of the software. Hence it is not likely you can in the beginning choose the right abstractions. Endquote. This is a reference to "Programming as theory building"\n  * > Get it into a state that will support current business goals and roadmap while protecting current business value and users.\n\n\nNote: the quotes are copied directly from the discussion page and are property of the original commentators.

Also, you will learn about the birth of the new generation of web designers, who are designing web pages in Web Design 3.0.\n\n> In Chapter 2, we will talk about website builders that are lagging behind the trends and slowing down the Web Design evolution.\n\n> In Chapter 3, you will learn how to create modern web designs quickly and easily in a new way.\n\nHas walk through the different design phases, techniques; both in press (printed) design as in web design.\n\nExplains some web builders.\n\nExplains the concept of the web 3.0:\n\n>  * Free positioning.\n>  * Element overlapping.\n>  * Breaking the limitations of Bootstrap-like Grids.\n\nStates the different needs for webmasters and designers:\n\n> Web Designers need:\n> \n>   * Free positioning\n>   * Removing table constraints\n>   * Layers\n>   * Property Panel for elements\n>   * Support for Windows and Mac OS\n> \n> \n> Webmasters need:\n> \n>   * Clean HTML and CSS\n>   * Mobile device support\n>   * WordPress and Joomla support\n>   * Building websites online\n\nSummary\n\n> Website builders are lagging behind the rapidly changing Web Design world.\n> \n> The history of web design tools has involved several transitions. However, progress has stopped. There are numerous signs that the new transition must happen.\n> \n> There are separate markets for web designers and webmasters. Popular website builders do not support the main features of Web Design 3.0: free positioning, modern grids, and layers.

Title: Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.
Link: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests
Body: This is a paraphrasing of some advice for healthy eating: 'Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.' (Pollan)\n\n> Write tests.\n\n> Often I find myself saving time when I put time in to write tests\n\n> Not too many: you get diminishing returns on your tests as the coverage increases [...]\n\n> Mostly integration: as you move up the pyramid, the confidence quotient of each form of testing increases\n\n> Integration tests strike a great balance on the trade-offs between confidence and speed/expense

Title: 7 Rules for Eating
Link: https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20090323/7-rules-for-eating
Body: In this reference article, Michael Pollan explains his seven rules for eating:\n\n  1. Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize as food. "When you pick up that box of portable yogurt tubes, or eat something with 15 ingredients you can't pronounce, ask yourself, "What are those things doing there?" Pollan says.\n  1. Don’t eat anything with more than five ingredients, or ingredients you can't pronounce.\n  1. Stay out of the middle of the supermarket; shop on the perimeter of the store. Real food tends to be on the outer edge of the store near the loading docks, where it can be replaced with fresh foods when it goes bad.\n  1. Don't eat anything that won't eventually rot. "There are exceptions -- honey -- but as a rule, things like Twinkies that never go bad aren't food," Pollan says.\n  1. It is not just what you eat but how you eat. "Always leave the table a little hungry," Pollan says. "Many cultures have rules that you stop eating before you are full. In Japan, they say eat until you are four-fifths full. Islamic culture has a similar rule, and in German culture they say, 'Tie off the sack before it's full.'"\n  1. Families traditionally ate together, around a table and not a TV, at regular meal times. It's a good tradition. Enjoy meals with the people you love. "Remember when eating between meals felt wrong?" Pollan asks.\n  1. Don't buy food where you buy your gasoline. In the U.S., 20% of food is eaten in the car.\n\n\nAlso, four myths:\n\n  1. Food is a delivery vehicle for nutrients. What really matters isn't broccoli but its fiber and antioxidants. If we get that right, we get our diet right. Foods kind of get in the way.\n  1. We need experts to tell us how to eat. Nutrients are invisible and mysterious. "It is a little like religion," Pollan said. "If a powerful entity is invisible, you need a priesthood to mediate your relation with food."\n  1. The whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. "You are either improving or ruining your health when you eat -- that is a very American idea," Pollan says. "But there are many other reasons to eat food: pleasure, social community, identity, and ritual. Health is not the only thing going on on our plates."\n  1. There are evil foods and good foods. "At any given time there is an evil nutrient we try to drive like Satan from the food supply -- first it was saturated fats, then it was trans fat," Pollan says. "Then there is the evil nutrient's doppelganger, the blessed nutrient. If we get enough of that we, will be healthy and maybe live forever. It's funny through history how the good and bad guys keep changing."\n\nThis can all be summarized as "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."

Body: This article puts testing in an economic perspective. Calls it lean testing\n\nAlso references/paraphrases Michael Pollan's Rules for eating ().\n\nCreates a testing trophy, a figure to explain the best testing pattern, replacing the testing pyramid\n\nExplains return on investment (ROI) on tests\n\n> integration tests provide the best balance of cost, speed and confidence\n\n> Integration tests lie somewhere between unit tests and end-to-end tests so they provide the best balance. Therefore, they have the highest ROI.\n\n> The main idea is to just not mock so much\n

Title: End-user programming
Link: https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html
Body: In this article, the writer explains some of the end-user modifications to programs. Examples include: adding download capabilities to instagram, generating backups for files.\n\nOn the other hand, applications (especially mobile) are tightly sealed, not allowing modification or extension. Even FOSS (free, open source software), modification implies the learning curve / entry barrier of having to setup, compile, debug the original program and modifications.\n\nGives the example of the UNIX command line, as a programming environment. One that provides (one of) the best REPL examples.\n\nCharacterizes spreadsheets as ad-hoc databases, programs; mostly created by domain experts (aka subject matter experts), than professional software engineers. Take into account that these hats are non-exclusive: a domain expert can also be a professional software engineer.\n\nThe author tries to coin the term "end-user programming" to differentiate it from programming by professional software developers, who try to build general-purpose apps, to be used by thousands of people.\n\nThis also means, that a professional software developer can be an "end-user programmer", when creating solutions for themselves (limited user group), rather than for the general public. Maybe those one-off scripts that we create, are some kind of end-user programs. This is described in the article as well.\n\nTalks of the chasm the user has to cross in order to customize the behaviour of their software. This is related to working in a framework or a library, in the sense of 'who keeps the control'. In an UNIX, filesystem environment, you keep the control.\n\n\nReferences "citizen developers" (https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/citizen-developer/) \n\n Three qualities for end-user programming: embodiment, living systems, and in-place toolchains \n\n  Embodiment: it requires the programmer hold many abstractions in their mind. Related to abstract reasoning. Mentions that many end-users don't have these abstractions in their mind, but are capable of abstract reasoning in their own domains of expertise. Mentions that via visual representations onscreen, we can help the end-user. An example: preview formula results in a spreadsheet; highlight the cells in a spreadsheet.\n\nEmbodiment means, broadly, making elements of the programming experience more concrete and visual\n\n\nLiving systems: interaction with them. Refers to shortening the feedback cycle\n\n> “Live programming gives the programmer immediate feedback on the behavior of a program as it is edited, replacing the edit compile-debug cycle with a fluid programming experience.“\n\nBut only short feedback loops, but also to change the system behaviour from within, such as the LISP compiler reading and compiling the source code from inside a program.\n\nIn-place tool chains\n\n> The user should be able to edit their programs without installing additional tools or programs\n\n> a Unix shell script is just a series of commands saved into a text file\n\nMeaning that the user is already accustomed to issuing those commands. A script is just grouping those commands.\n\nGives examples of end-user programming success stories: spreadsheets, SQL, browser dev tools,

Title: Why developers consider Agile development to be nonsense
Link: https://medium.com/@web.development/why-developers-consider-agile-development-to-be-nonsense-1eaf28715e66
Body: This article explains how Agile development is apt and indicated for short-term software development, especially for contracting or consulting companies, where the client is external to the team.\n\nWhy it does not make as much sense in products/services where there is a leapfrog solution.\n\n> Don’t give the customer what they ask for; understand them, and revolutionize their world.
