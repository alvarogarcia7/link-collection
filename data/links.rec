Title: Don’t Know What You Want? Improve These 7 Universal Skills
Link: Self-Discipline: Get better at ignoring the negative voice in your head. Get out of your bed. Go to the gym. Don’t listen to “I don’t want to.”
Body: Personal Effectiveness: Learn how to maximize the results you can get during the 16–18 hours you’re awake. Get more done — effectively.\nCommunication: We think we’re all master communicators. But the truth is that we suck. Communication is both art and science. And our ability to work with others depends on it.\nNegotiation: You negotiate all the time. With your spouse, kids, parents, teachers, friends, co-workers, managers, etc. Learn to get the best deal for all parties.\nPersuasion: Learn how to get what you want in an ethical way.\nPhysical Strength & Stamina: Getting stronger is a skill. Pull your own weight. It’s something every human should be able to do.\nFlexibility: Sitting all day long behind your computer or in your car turns you into a stiff being. Learn how to stretch your hips, lower back, hamstrings, and calves — the most common weak points of desk workers.

Body: I've read this article by John Bell, John Zada on the current war for attention, what they call the 'attention heist': publishers fight for your attention, selling it to third parties. The more they can lure you to spend your (finite) attention with them, the higher the profits.\n\nThey talk about two kinds of attention: short span and long span. Reading news is the first while reading a book or a long article is the second one.\n\nThey mention unplugging (i.e., a "digital sabbath") to help improving the level of concentration\n\n(this was a book review, of 'The attention merchants', by Tim Wu)

Hyperbolic Discounting: Going for an immediate payoff instead of a delayed larger one\n1. IKEA Effect:Overvaluing your own solutions to a problem, and thus in contrast undervalue other solutions. Also called the "Not-Invented-Here (NIH) Syndrome"\n1. Premature Optimization: Optimizing before you know that you need to.\n1. Planning Fallacy: Optimistically underestimating the time required to complete a task\n1. Recency Bias: Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past\n\n> We can never completely eliminate our biases, by being aware of how it is affecting us, we can somewhat mitigate the problems it causes.\n\nBy Yash Ranadive\n

Link: https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/
Body: I've read this paper commentary by Adrian Colyer (on a paper by Zheng Gao, Christian Bird, Earl T. Barr) on a study that tries to reproduce fixes for defects based on the dynamic to static typing system. \n\n>  both Flow and TypeScript are pretty good, and conservatively either of them can prevent about 15% of the bugs that end up in committed code.\n\nIt's interesting to see these effects quantified: \n\n> Running the binomial test on the results shows that, at the confidence level of 95%, the true percentage of detectable bugs for Flow and TypeScript falls into [11.5%, 18.5%] with mean 15%.\n\nAlso, some recommendations for the future: for typescript and flow to be compatible for more gains.\n\nOriginal paper: http://ttendency.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/type_study/documents/type_study.pdf
