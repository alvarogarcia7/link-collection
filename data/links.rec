Title: Don’t Know What You Want? Improve These 7 Universal Skills
Link: Self-Discipline: Get better at ignoring the negative voice in your head. Get out of your bed. Go to the gym. Don’t listen to “I don’t want to.”
Body: Personal Effectiveness: Learn how to maximize the results you can get during the 16–18 hours you’re awake. Get more done — effectively.
+ Communication: We think we’re all master communicators. But the truth is that we suck. Communication is both art and science. And our ability to work with others depends on it.
+ Negotiation: You negotiate all the time. With your spouse, kids, parents, teachers, friends, co-workers, managers, etc. Learn to get the best deal for all parties.
+ Persuasion: Learn how to get what you want in an ethical way.
+ Physical Strength & Stamina: Getting stronger is a skill. Pull your own weight. It’s something every human should be able to do.
+ Flexibility: Sitting all day long behind your computer or in your car turns you into a stiff being. Learn how to stretch your hips, lower back, hamstrings, and calves — the most common weak points of desk workers.

+ 1. Planning Fallacy: Optimistically underestimating the time required to complete a task
+ 1. Recency Bias: Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past
+ 
+ > We can never completely eliminate our biases, by being aware of how it is affecting us, we can somewhat mitigate the problems it causes.

Link: https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/
Body: I've read this paper commentary by Adrian Colyer (on a paper by Zheng Gao, Christian Bird, Earl T. Barr) on a study that tries to reproduce fixes for defects based on the dynamic to static typing system. 
+ 
+ >  both Flow and TypeScript are pretty good, and conservatively either of them can prevent about 15% of the bugs that end up in committed code.
+ 
+ It's interesting to see these effects quantified: 
+ 
+ > Running the binomial test on the results shows that, at the confidence level of 95%, the true percentage of detectable bugs for Flow and TypeScript falls into [11.5%, 18.5%] with mean 15%.
+ 
+ Also, some recommendations for the future: for typescript and flow to be compatible for more gains.

+ Policies are objects that tweak or adapt the object's behaviour to the needs of the system.
+ Parts are components in the implementation that are not controlled from outside the object after being set.

+   * Segundo: resaltar algo positivo de ella.  Seguro que algo cumple.
+   * Tercero: decir cómo mejorarías un aspecto
+   * Último: volver a dar las gracias o decir una frase buena que motive.
+  
+ Dar un mal feedback es muy fácil:
+   * Primero: no leerte la descripción ni el nivel de la charla
+   * Segundo: te cabreas porque no es lo esperado y dudabas entre esa y otra charla
+   * Tercero: dices lo que no te ha gustado sin rodeos.
+   * Cuarto: además asumes cosas que no ha hecho y las escribes. Igual que yo he hecho en el Primero y Segundo.
+   * Quinto: si además dices algo faltoso gana puntos.
+   * Sexto: Utilizas esa tónica destructiva en todos.

Title: Ask HN: How to be productive with big existing code base
Origin: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19254008
Body: In this HN discussion, there are some pearls regarding working with big, legacy codebases:
+   * Just because you wouldn't have done it the way they did doesn't mean they did it wrong. A reference to [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence)
+   * A reference to Working Effectively With Legacy Code, by Feathers

Body: In Chapter 1, we will find out how Web Design is changing. Also, you will learn about the birth of the new generation of web designers, who are designing web pages in Web Design 3.0.
+ > In Chapter 2, we will talk about website builders that are lagging behind the trends and slowing down the Web Design evolution.
+ > In Chapter 3, you will learn how to create modern web designs quickly and easily in a new way.
+ Has walk through the different design phases, techniques; both in press (printed) design as in web design.
+ Explains some web builders.
+ Explains the concept of the web 3.0:
+ >  * Free positioning.
+ >  * Element overlapping.
+ >  * Breaking the limitations of Bootstrap-like Grids.
+ States the different needs for webmasters and designers:
+ > Web Designers need:
+ > 
+ >   * Free positioning
+ >   * Removing table constraints
+ >   * Layers
+ >   * Property Panel for elements
+ >   * Support for Windows and Mac OS
+ > 
+ >

+ >   * WordPress and Joomla support
+ >   * Building websites online
+ Summary
+ > Website builders are lagging behind the rapidly changing Web Design world.
+ > 
+ > The history of web design tools has involved several transitions. However, progress has stopped. There are numerous signs that the new transition must happen.
+ > 
+ > There are separate markets for web designers and webmasters. Popular website builders do not support the main features of Web Design 3.0: free positioning, modern grids, and layers.

Title: 7 Rules for Eating
Link: https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20090323/7-rules-for-eating
Body: In this reference article, Michael Pollan explains his seven rules for eating:
+   1. Don't eat anything your great grandmother wouldn't recognize as food. "When you pick up that box of portable yogurt tubes, or eat something with 15 ingredients you can't pronounce, ask yourself, "What are those things doing there?" Pollan says.
+   1. Don’t eat anything with more than five ingredients, or ingredients you can't pronounce.
+   1. Stay out of the middle of the supermarket; shop on the perimeter of the store. Real food tends to be on the outer edge of the store near the loading docks, where it can be replaced with fresh foods when it goes bad.
+   1. Don't eat anything that won't eventually rot. "There are exceptions -- honey -- but as a rule, things like Twinkies that never go bad aren't food," Pollan says.
+   1. It is not just what you eat but how you eat. "Always leave the table a little hungry," Pollan says. "Many cultures have rules that you stop eating before you are full. In Japan, they say eat until you are four-fifths full. Islamic culture has a similar rule, and in German culture they say, 'Tie off the sack before it's full.'"
+   1. Families traditionally ate together, around a table and not a TV, at regular meal times. It's a good tradition. Enjoy meals with the people you love. "Remember when eating between meals felt wrong?" Pollan asks.
+   1. Don't buy food where you buy your gasoline. In the U.S., 20% of food is eaten in the car.
+ 
+ Also, four myths:
+   1. Food is a delivery vehicle for nutrients. What really matters isn't broccoli but its fiber and antioxidants. If we get that right, we get our diet right. Foods kind of get in the way.
+   1. We need experts to tell us how to eat. Nutrients are invisible and mysterious. "It is a little like religion," Pollan said. "If a powerful entity is invisible, you need a priesthood to mediate your relation with food."
+   1. The whole point of eating is to maintain and promote bodily health. "You are either improving or ruining your health when you eat -- that is a very American idea," Pollan says. "But there are many other reasons to eat food: pleasure, social community, identity, and ritual. Health is not the only thing going on on our plates."
+   1. There are evil foods and good foods. "At any given time there is an evil nutrient we try to drive like Satan from the food supply -- first it was saturated fats, then it was trans fat," Pollan says. "Then there is the evil nutrient's doppelganger, the blessed nutrient. If we get enough of that we, will be healthy and maybe live forever. It's funny through history how the good and bad guys keep changing."
+ This can all be summarized as "Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."

Title: End-user programming
Link: https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html
Body: In this article, the writer explains some of the end-user modifications to programs. Examples include: adding download capabilities to instagram, generating backups for files.
+ On the other hand, applications (especially mobile) are tightly sealed, not allowing modification or extension. Even FOSS (free, open source software), modification implies the learning curve / entry barrier of having to setup, compile, debug the original program and modifications.
+ Gives the example of the UNIX command line, as a programming environment. One that provides (one of) the best REPL examples.
+ Characterizes spreadsheets as ad-hoc databases, programs; mostly created by domain experts (aka subject matter experts), than professional software engineers. Take into account that these hats are non-exclusive: a domain expert can also be a professional software engineer.
+ The author tries to coin the term "end-user programming" to differentiate it from programming by professional software developers, who try to build general-purpose apps, to be used by thousands of people.
+ This also means, that a professional software developer can be an "end-user programmer", when creating solutions for themselves (limited user group), rather than for the general public. Maybe those one-off scripts that we create, are some kind of end-user programs. This is described in the article as well.
+ Talks of the chasm the user has to cross in order to customize the behaviour of their software. This is related to working in a framework or a library, in the sense of 'who keeps the control'. In an UNIX, filesystem environment, you keep the control.
+ 
+ References "citizen developers" (https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/citizen-developer/) 
+  Three qualities for end-user programming: embodiment, living systems, and in-place toolchains 
+   Embodiment: it requires the programmer hold many abstractions in their mind. Related to abstract reasoning. Mentions that many end-users don't have these abstractions in their mind, but are capable of abstract reasoning in their own domains of expertise. Mentions that via visual representations onscreen, we can help the end-user. An example: preview formula results in a spreadsheet; highlight the cells in a spreadsheet.
+ Embodiment means, broadly, making elements of the programming experience more concrete and visual
+ 
+ Living systems: interaction with them. Refers to shortening the feedback cycle
+ > “Live programming gives the programmer immediate feedback on the behavior of a program as it is edited, replacing the edit compile-debug cycle with a fluid programming experience.“
+ But only short feedback loops, but also to change the system behaviour from within, such as the LISP compiler reading and compiling the source code from inside a program.
+ In-place tool chains
+ > The user should be able to edit their programs without installing additional tools or programs
+ > a Unix shell script is just a series of commands saved into a text file
+ Meaning that the user is already accustomed to issuing those commands. A script is just grouping those commands.
+ Gives examples of end-user programming success stories: spreadsheets, SQL, browser dev tools,

+   > * Flexible working hours over set working hours.
+   > * Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
+   > * Written down processes over on-the-job training.
+   > * Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
+   > * Opening up every document for editing by anyone over top-down control of documents.
+   > * Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.
+   > * The results of work over the hours put in.
+   > * Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.
+ Some tools to make this happen:
+   * Faster internet everywhere - 100Mb/s+ cable, 5GHz Wifi, 4G cellular
+   * Video call software - Google Hangouts, Zoom
+   * Mobile technology - Everyone has a computer in their pocket
+   * Evolution of speech-to-text conversion software - more accurate and faster than typing
+   * Messaging apps - Slack, Mattermost, Zulip
+   * Issue trackers - Trello, GitHub issues, GitLab issues
+   * Suggestions - GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests
+   * Static websites - GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages
+   * English proficiency - More people are learning English
+   * Increasing traffic congestion in cities

Title: 7 Strange Questions That Help You Find Your Life Purpose
Link: https://markmanson.net/life-purpose
Body: This article talks about the life purpose.
+ > Everything sucks, some of the time.
+ The author has some questions:
+   1. What's the flavor of your shit sandwich? Recognize that everything has a price. You must be ready to pay that price if you want the item (El código del dinero; Samsó)
+   1. What's true about you today that would make your 8-year old self cry? What is something that we do as adults, but your child self would not accept? >  don’t just look at the activities that keep you up all night, but look at the cognitive principles behind those activities that enthrall you. Because they can easily be applied elsewhere.
+   1. What makes you forget to eat and poop? This is related to Flow (psychology)
+   1. How can you better embarrass yourself? Related to making more mistakes (source unknown)
+   1. How are you going to save the world? Define your own big goals, greater than yourself or your pleasure or satisfaction. [Sagiv, L., & Schwartz, S. H. (2000). Value priorities and subjective well-being: direct relations and congruity effects. European Journal of Social Psychology, 30(2), 177–198.]
+   1. What would you do if you were forced to do something?
+   1. How would you like to be remembered, knowing that you will die in one year? Related to the Frugalwoods exercise of the desired bio.
+ What's the purpose of life is equivalent to asking 'What can I do with my life, of importance?'.

Body: In this video, Alain de Botton explains how for marrying someone, for loving someone, you have to love yourself first.
+ > You can be addicted to anything as long as it keeps you away from yourself. 
+  Two types of engagement to someone else:
+  * Anxious attachment: rather than saying I need you, I depend on you. It's a way of evaluating through proxy variables (such as did you do this) rather than the real variable (e.g., do you care about me)
+  * Avoidance: when you need someone, you pretend you don't. "I'm busy". You don't reveal the need for the other person. Cycle of low trust.
+  
+  Love as a skill that needs to be learned. Difference between loving and being loved.

Title: Experienced programmers and computer scientists, what are some really old (or even nearly forgotten) books you think every new programmer should read?
Link: https://www.quora.com/Experienced-programmers-and-computer-scientists-what-are-some-really-old-or-even-nearly-forgotten-books-you-think-every-new-programmer-should-read
Body:   * I’m still a big fan of the "Lisp 1.5 Programmers Manual" (MIT Press — still in print). This version of the language is no longer with us, but the book — first written ca 1962 — by John McCarthy, who invented, and his colleagues, who implemented, is a perfect classic.
+   * It starts with a version of John’s first papers about Lisp, and develops the ideas in a few pages of examples to culminate on page 13 with Lisp eval and apply defined in itself. There are many other thought provoking ideas and examples throughout the rest of the book.
+   * The way to grow from this book is to deeply learn what they did and how they did it, and then try to rewrite page 13 in a number of ways. How nicely can this be written in "a lisp" using recursion. How nicely can this be written without recursion? (In both cases, look ahead in the book to see that Lisp 1.5 had gotten to the idea of EXPRs and FEXPRs (functions which don’t eval their arguments before the call — thus they can be used to replace all the "special forms" — do a Lisp made from FEXPRs and get the rest by definition, etc.).
+   * What is a neat bootstrapping path? How could you combine this with Val Shorre’s "Meta II" programmatic parser to make a really extensible language? What does it take to get to "objects"? What are three or four really interesting (and different ways) to think about objects here? (Hints: how many different ways can you define "closures" in a language that executes? What about using Lisp atoms as a model for objects? Etc.)
+   * The idea is that Lisp is not just a language but a really deep "building material" that is tidy enough to "think with" not just make things (it’s a "building material" for thoughts as well as computer processes).
+   * Dani Richard reminded me to mention: "Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines" by Marvin Minsky (Prentice-Hall, 1967), which — since it is one of my favorite books of all time — I’m surprised I didn’t include in the original list. Marvin could really write, and in this book he is at his best. It is actually a "math book" — with lots of ideas, theorems, proofs, etc., — but presented in the friendliest way imaginable by a great mind who treated everyone — including children — as equal to him, and as fellow appreciators of great ideas. There are lots of interesting things to ponder in this book, but perhaps it is the approach that beckons to the reader to start thinking "like this" that is the most rewarding.
+   * "Advances in Programming and Non-Numerical Computation" (Ed. L. Fox) mid-60s. The papers presented at a 1963 summer workshop in the UK. The most provocative ones were by Christopher Strachey and several by Peter Landin. This was one of the books that Bob Barton had us read in his famous advanced systems design class in 1967.
+   * Try "The Mythical Man-Month" by Fred Brooks, for an early look and experience with timeless truths (and gotchas) from systems building with teams …
+   * Try "The Sciences of the Artificial" by Herb Simon. A much stronger way to think about computing — and what "Computer Science" might mean — by a much stronger thinker than most today.
+   * "A Programming Language" by Ken Iverson (ca 1962). This has the same thought expanding properties of Lisp. And, like Lisp, the way to learn from these really old ideas is to concentrate on what is unique and powerful in the approach (we know how to better improve both Lisp and APL today, but the deep essence is perhaps easier to grasp in the original manifestations of the ideas). Another book that Barton had us read.
+   * I like Dave Fisher’s 1970 CMU Thesis — "Control Structures for Programming Languages" — most especially the first 100 pages. Still a real gem for helping to think about design and implementations.
+   * More recent: (80s) "The Meta-Object Protocol" by Kiczales, et al. The first section and example is a must to read and understand.
+   * Joe Armstrong’s PhD thesis — after many years of valuable experience with Erlang — was published as a book ca 2003 …
+   * Lots more out there for curious minds ….
+   * Mind Storms, by Seymour Pappert.
+   * The Elements of Programming Style, by Kernighan and Plaguer.
+   * Classics is Software Engineering, edited by Edward Yourdon, 1979 (While this book was published in 1979, it contains articles published by giants in Software Engineering from the ’60s and ‘70s).
+   * Programming on Purpose: Essays on Software Design, by PJ Plaguer.
+   * Byte Magazine, Volume 6, Number 8, August 1981, Editor in Chief Christopher Morgan.
+   * Programming Pearls, by Jon Bentley.
+   * Data Structures, This was a truly wonderful book. It was part of a computer science series. I read in the ‘70s, but I can’t find it now and I don’t remember the name of the author.
+   * Introduction to Algorithms, by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (known as CLRS).
+   * The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1…4, by Donald Knuth.
+   * Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools, by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman, 1986 (known as The Dragon Book).
+   * I would mention Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the InterNET, by Katie Hafner, but, it’s only from 1998 so I’m not sure it’s old enough.
+   * The Elements of Programming Style by Kernighan and Plauger
+   * Controlling Software Projects by Tom DeMarco
+   * The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks
+   * Peopleware by DeMarco and Lister
+   * The Secrets of Consulting by Gerry Weinberg
+   * The Psychology of Computer Programming by Gerry Weinberg
+   * The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design by Meilir Page-Jones

+   * A Spiral Model of Software Development and Enhancement http://csse.usc.edu/TECHRPTS/198...
+   * Clean Code
+   * I also really like Thinking in Java by a wonderful author called Bruce Eckel. As the title says, it teaches you to think OOP and really understand the design behind the language and the lessons it was designed after. The book is from 2006, so it is dated. But it is worth your time and is free to download!
+   * My favorite programming book to date is still Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, more popularly known as SICP. It’s old, but not forgotten for good reason. I hear many colleges are dropping this book, which is a crying shame.
+   * Mathematics for Computer Science is another unsung book. I don’t know of many who has read through this one, but it’s truly mind-expanding and mind-blowing.
+   * A book that’s often dismissed and forgotten in this day of "flavor of the week" JavaScript frameworks is JavaScript, the Good Parts. While it’s newer (10-ish years old), I wish more people would take a look at this one. Even if you never write JS in your life, you will walk away a better thinker.
+   * Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck (2000) — how taking everything to the extreme makes everything easier. Hugely influential for me at a time when most projects were waterfall-style change management exercises. This explains how to be agile.
+   * Smalltalk, Objects, and Design by Chamond Liu (1996) — a nice introduction to the elegant mother of all object oriented languages, but also covers design patterns, MVC, UI design and use of metaphors. A smorgasbord of developer insights that are still relevant today.
+   * Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics by Newman and Sproull (1979) — this book inspired me to get into programming. It explains the science of recreating the real world on a computer screen. Not so much about writing code, but about the mathematics, algorithms, and hardware.
+   * The C Programming Language
+   * The Unix Programming Environment
+   * SICP
+   * Tom Gilb’s - Principles of Software Engineering Management.
+   * His principles are classic:
+   * The invisible target principle All critical system attributes must be specified clearly. Invisible targets are usually hard to hit (except by chance).
+   * The all-the-holes-in-the-boat principle Your design solutions must satisfy all critical attributes simultaneously.
+   * The clear-the-fog-from-the-target principle All critical attributes can be specified in measurable testable terms, and the worst-acceptable level can be identified.
+   * The learn-before-your-budget-is-used-up principle Never attempt to deliver large and complex systems all at once; try to deliver them in many smaller increments, so that you can discover the problems and correct them early.
+   * The keep-pinching-yourself-to-see-if-you-are-dreaming principle Don’t believe blindly in any one method; use your methods and common sense to measure the reality against your needs.
+   * The fail-safe minimization principle If you don’t know what you’re doing, don’t do it on a large scale.
+   * Object-Oriented Software Construction - Wikipedia (by Betrand Meyer)
+   * Smalltalk-80 (http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/...)
+   * You might want to take a look at DoradoList where it has lists of great computer engineering and science books suggested by some world-renowned professors from MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley and more. Interestingly there is a section in that website that is called Gems and per website it is compiled as: "There are many books that are perhaps somewhat out of date in a broad sense but that have wonderful insights that have perhaps been overlooked. In this section, we have asked the top experts if they know of any of this type of hidden/forgotten gems. You can see their responses that we have categorized". It looks there is a section for Computer Programming there as well.
+   * Everything by Robert Glass
+   * Mindstorms
+   * Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams
+   * Computer Science, Logo Style by Brian Harvey (3 volumes)
+   * Mirror Worlds
+   * Starting Forth / Thinking Forth
+   * The C Programming Language
+   * The AWK Programming Language
+   * There are many other good books, some mentioned in other answers. My list touches on some different types of languages, which are small and tractable, but offer a broad sampling of ideas. The Harvey series shows that a language used to teach children has deceived many into thinking it wasn’t powerful.
+   * I love Per Brinch Hansen’s Programming a Personal Computer. It focusses on the Edison programming language, which is an incredibly small and simple language. Edison resembles Pascal to some extent.
+   * The book shows how to use Edison to write a complete operating system for a "personal computer." It even provides the complete source code listing!
+   * Edison was designed for multi-processor computing, sort of like the Golang of the day. This book was the first to convince me that small and simple was a very good thing.
+   * And that’s why Smalltalk is my favourite programming language today. See Richard Kenneth Eng's answer to What programming language was for you an absolute pleasure to work with and why?

Title: What if You Only Invested at Market Peaks?
Link: https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/
Body: This post analyses what happens if you only invest at market peaks.
+ Lessons learned:
+   * If you are going to make investment mistakes, make sure you are biased towards optimism and not pessimism. Long-term thinking has been rewarded in the past and unless you think the world or innovation is coming to an end it should be rewarded in the future. As Winston Churchill once said, “I am an optimist.  It does not seem too much use being anything else.”
+   * Losses are part of the deal when investing in stocks.  How you react to those losses is one of the biggest determinants of your investment performance.
+   * Saving more, thinking long-term and allowing compound interest to work in your favor are your biggest accelerants for building wealth. These factors have nothing to do with picking stocks or a complex investment strategy. Get these big things right and any disciplined investment strategy should do the trick.

Title: Are You a Self-Interrupter?
Link: http://nautil.us/issue/48/Chaos/are-you-a-self_interrupter
Body: There are two approaches by which we can diminish the negative impact of interference on our lives: changing our brains and changing our behavior
+ In terms of changing our brains, laboratories and companies around the world are now engaged in large-scale development and research efforts directed at understanding how we can enhance our brain’s functioning to improve cognitive control and thus reduce the negative impact of goal interference. Approaches include traditional education, meditation, cognitive training, video games, exposure to nature, drugs, physical exercise, neuro-feedback, and brain stimulation. Interestingly, many of them use modern technology to harness neuroplasticity and induce brain changes. We are at the threshold of fascinating times, as the technology that has aggravated the Distracted Mind is now being formulated to offer remediation. When we have no choice but to engage in a high-interference environment, we can work to ensure we are as optimized as possible to diminish the detrimental effects of distractions and interruptions.
+ It may seem difficult to change our habits, but at many points throughout history we have decided to modify how we interact with our environment after we’ve realized the harmful effects of a particular behavior. For example, prior to the overwhelming evidence of the dangers of cigarette use, doctors would actually recommend specific brands in advertisements. With increasing knowledge of the detrimental effects of this sort of behavior, and others such as the dangers of sun exposure, came the opportunity for us to make more informed decisions.

Body: >Engage not the mind in the intense pursuit of too many things at once; especially such as have no relation to one another. This will be ready to distract the understanding and hinder it from attaining perfection in any one subject of study. Such a practice gives a slight smattering of several sciences, without any solid and substantial knowledge of them, and without any real and valuable improvement; and though two or three sorts of study may be usefully carried on at once, to entertain the mind with variety, that it may not be overtired with one sort of thoughts, yet a multitude of subjects will too much distract the attention and weaken the application of the mind to any one of them.

Title: Statistically Rigorous Java Performance Evaluation
Link: https://dri.es/files/oopsla07-georges.pdf
Body: > Java performance is far from being trivial to benchmark because it is affected by various factors such as the Java application, its input, the virtual machine, the garbage collector, the heap size, etc.
+ > In addition, non-determinism at run-time causes the execution time of a Java program to differ from run to run. There are a number of sources of non-determinism such as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation
+ > and optimization in the virtual machine (VM) driven by timerbased method sampling, thread scheduling, garbage collection, and various system effects.
+ > 
+ > There exist a wide variety of Java performance evaluation methodologies used by researchers and benchmarkers. These methodologies differ from each other in a number of ways. Some report average performance over a number of runs of the same experiment; others report the best or second best performance observed; yet others report the worst. Some iterate the benchmark multiple times within a single VM invocation; others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate a single benchmark execution; yet others consider multiple VM invocations and iterate the benchmark multiple times.
+ > 
+ > This paper shows that prevalent methodologies can be misleading, and can even lead to incorrect conclusions. The reason is that the data analysis is not statistically rigorous. In this paper, we present a survey of xisting Java performance evaluation methodologies and discuss the importance of statistically rigorous data analysis for dealing with non-determinism. We advocate approaches to quantify startup as well as steady-state performance, and, in addition, we provide the JavaStats software to automatically obtain performance numbers in a rigorous manner. Although this paper focuses on Java performance evaluation, many of the issues addressed in this paper also apply to other programming languages and systems that build on a managed runtime system.

Body: learnings from a senior developer to a more younger self:
+ * If you (or your team) are shooting yourselves in the foot constantly, fix the gun
+ * Assess the trade-off you’re making between quality and pace, make sure it’s appropriate for your context
+ * Spending time sharpening the axe is almost always worth it
+ * If you can’t easily explain why something is difficult, then it’s incidental complexity, which is probably worth addressing
+ * Try to solve bugs one layer deeper
+ * Don’t underestimate the value of digging into history to investigate some bugs
+ * Bad code gives you feedback, perfect code doesn’t. Err on the side of writing bad code
+ * Make debugging easier
+ * When working on a team, you should usually ask the question
+ * Shipping cadence matters a lot. Think hard about what will get you shipping quickly and often
+ * You are not your job

Title: Properly testing concurrent data structures
Body: There’s a fascinating Rust library, loom, which can be used to thoroughly test lock-free data structures. I always wanted to learn how it works. I still do! But recently I accidentally implemented a small toy which, I think, contains some of the loom’s ideas, and it seems worthwhile to write about that
